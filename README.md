# C-codes-in-BorlandC-3.1
This is my very first repository created on 29th July, 2023, PST. It contains codes to simulate the Windows Explorer, written for the C programming course project in AIA, HUST. 

**Do note that this code can only be complied by Borland C, version3.1.**

Any questions please email to wong@hust.edu.cn
